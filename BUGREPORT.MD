# Bug Report for Petstore API Tests

## Bug 1: Inconsistent Pet Retrieval After Creation

**Severity**: High

**Priority**: High

**Description**:
After successfully creating a new pet using the POST /pet endpoint, attempts to immediately retrieve the pet using GET /pet/{petId} consistently fail with a 404 Not Found error. This occurs even with multiple retry attempts and delays between requests.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Create a new pet using POST /pet endpoint.
2. Immediately attempt to retrieve the created pet using GET /pet/{petId}.
3. Observe that the request fails with a 404 Not Found error.
4. Retry the GET request multiple times with delays between attempts.

**Expected Behavior**:
The newly created pet should be immediately available for retrieval, or within a reasonable time frame (e.g., within a few seconds).

**Actual Behavior**:
The API returns a 404 Not Found error when attempting to retrieve the pet, even after multiple retry attempts with delays.

**Reproduction Rate**: 100%

**Environment**:

- API: Petstore Swagger API (https://petstore.swagger.io/)
- Test Framework: Jest with TypeScript
- HTTP Client: Axios

**Impact**:
This issue significantly affects the reliability and usability of the API. It prevents clients from verifying the successful creation of pets and may lead to data inconsistencies or user experience issues in applications relying on this API.

**Possible Causes**:

1. Data propagation delay in the API's backend systems.
2. Caching issues preventing immediate access to newly created data.
3. Potential race condition in the API's create-then-read operations.
4. Intentional behavior to simulate real-world scenarios or test error handling in client applications.

**Workaround**:
Currently, there is no known workaround to consistently retrieve a pet immediately after creation. Client applications may need to implement robust retry mechanisms with increasing delays to handle this behavior.

**Recommendation**:

1. If this is an intentional behavior, it should be clearly documented in the API specifications to set proper expectations for API consumers.
2. If unintentional, investigate the backend systems for potential causes of this delay in data availability.
3. Consider implementing a "eventually consistent" flag in the API response to indicate that the resource may not be immediately available.

**Additional Notes**:
This behavior was consistently observed across multiple test runs and appears to be a fundamental characteristic of the current API implementation rather than an intermittent issue.

## Enhancement 2: Improve Error Handling for Invalid Input

**Severity**: Low

**Priority**: Medium

**Description**:
When sending invalid input to the POST /pet endpoint, the API currently returns a 500 Internal Server Error. While this correctly indicates that the request failed, it would be more appropriate to return a 400 Bad Request status code for client-side errors like invalid input.

**Current Behavior**:
The API returns a 500 Internal Server Error when receiving invalid input data.

**Proposed Enhancement**:
Update the API to return a 400 Bad Request status code with a descriptive error message when it receives invalid input data.

**Rationale**:
- A 400 Bad Request status code more accurately represents the nature of the error (client-side issue) compared to a 500 Internal Server Error (server-side issue).
- This change would improve API consistency and adhere better to RESTful API best practices.
- It would provide clearer feedback to API consumers, helping them quickly identify and correct input errors.

**Implementation Suggestion**:
1. Implement input validation on the server-side before processing the request.
2. If the input fails validation, return a 400 Bad Request status code.
3. Include a descriptive error message in the response body, detailing which fields are invalid and why.

**Example Response for Invalid Input**:
```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid input data",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "id",
      "error": "Must be a number"
    },
    {
      "field": "status",
      "error": "Must be one of: available, pending, sold"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Impact**:
This enhancement would improve the developer experience for API consumers, making it easier to debug and handle input-related issues. It would also bring the API more in line with RESTful best practices.

**Note**:
While this is not a critical bug, implementing this enhancement would significantly improve the API's usability and adherence to API design standards.
